# bootcamp-hw1 by Andrew Bergheim

## Description
This is a portfolio that I created as part of my coding bootcamp at the University of Arizona beginning in October 2019. It was created as an exercise
to practice using CSS, especially CSS positioning. As of October 31, 2019, it also serves as my publically available portfolio for prospective collaborators and employers. 

## Installation

The three HTML files, style.css and the images contained within this repository are all ready to use and will work properly when hosted using your preferred hosting provider, or can be edited and used offline if you so wish. 

## Usage

From the initial page (index.html), the portfolio page (portfolio.html) and the contact page (contact.html) can be accessed by clicking on their respective links in the header. 

## Credits

credit goes to W3schools (w3schools.com/css/) for their excellent CSS tutorials, without which very little progress would have been made, along with my instructors at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, provided by Trinity Educational Services.
