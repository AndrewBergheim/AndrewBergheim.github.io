                        I'm Andrew Bergheim, an aspiring programmer from San Diego, California. I'm currently taking a year out from my degree at Durham University in the United Kingdom
                         in order to learn to code and develop skills that will let me create practical tools to facilitate community organization. <br> <br>

                        Although I still have a lot to learn, over the next year I plan to develop my coding skills as much as possible in order to pursue
                         a career where I can utilize them to help drive positive change in my community. In our new digital age, there are few things that can bring people together
                          more effectively then a well-designed and well-made digital tool.<br><br>

                         Coding is a passion of mine, and one of my favorite creative outlets. There's no feeling more satisfying to me than turning a concept
                          into a functional application. I hope that after you take a look at my portfolio, you'll understand just how much I love what I do!
